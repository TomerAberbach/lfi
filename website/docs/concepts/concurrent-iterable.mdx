# Concurrent iterable

This is an in-depth explanation of concurrent iterables. For simple usage
examples, check out the ["Getting started" page](/docs/getting-started).

## What is it?

A concurrent iterable, also known as a "concur iterable", is a lazy collection
of values that can be iterated concurrently.

It is implemented as an object, represented by the `ConcurIterable` type, with a
function that:

- Does nothing until it is called
- Takes a callback that processes each emitted value
- Returns a promise that resolves when every value has been handled or rejects
  when an error occurs

A concur iterable is effectively a
[cold](https://kt.academy/article/cc-hot-cold#hot-vs-cold)
[push-based observable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming#Change_propagation_algorithms)
backed by some asynchronous operations.

## How is it different from an [`AsyncIterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_async_iterator_and_async_iterable_protocols)?

An async iterable is neither concurrent nor push-based. It is sequential and
pull-based.

For example, consider the following code:

```js playground
import { asConcur, forEachConcur, mapConcur, pipe, rangeTo } from 'lfi'

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))

const createConcurIterable = () =>
  pipe(
    rangeTo(0, 3),
    asConcur,
    mapConcur(() => delay(100)),
  )

console.time(`concur iterable iteration`)
await forEachConcur(unused => console.log(`Iterated!`), createConcurIterable())
console.timeEnd(`concur iterable iteration`)
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
// NOTE: This duration may vary slightly between runs
//=> concur iterable iteration: 100 ms

async function* createAsyncIterable() {
  yield delay(100)
  yield delay(100)
  yield delay(100)
}

console.time(`async iterable iteration`)
for await (const unused of createAsyncIterable()) {
  console.log(`Iterated!`)
}
console.timeEnd(`async iterable iteration`)
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
//=> Iterated!
// NOTE: This duration may vary slightly between runs
//=> async iterable iteration: 300 ms
```

Iterating over the concur iterable takes just 100 milliseconds while iterating
over the async iterable takes 300 milliseconds.

This is because the `delay` calls are awaited sequentially in the async
iterable, and the
[async generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*)
doesn't resume until the next time `for await...of` calls
[`next()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#next_2)
on the async iterator. The caller is responsible for pulling the next value from
the iterator.

However, the `delay` calls are awaited concurrently in the concur iterable. And
the caller is _not_ responsible for pulling the next value. The concur iterable
pushes out values as fast as it can. This also means the iteration order of
concur iterables is not deterministic. It depends how quickly each value
progresses through the iterable's operations.

:::note

The async iterable protocol's behavior is a feature, not an oversight.
Sequential iteration is required when the next value depends on previous values.
Plus, pull-based iteration manages
[backpressure](https://medium.com/@jayphelps/backpressure-explained-the-flow-of-data-through-software-2350b3e77ce7)
well. We can't always process values as quickly as they can be produced.

This is why `lfi` exports functions for async iterables in addition to concur
iterables.

## How is it different from chaining [`p-map`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map), [`p-filter`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-filter), and others?

Concur iterables are lazy, so they don't create an intermediate array for each
operation:

```js
import {
  asConcur,
  filterConcur,
  mapConcur,
  pipe,
  reduceConcur,
  toArray,
} from 'lfi'
import pFilter from 'p-filter'
import pMap from 'p-map'

// No intermediate arrays created
const finalArrayWithLfi = await pipe(
  asConcur(someArray),
  mapConcur(someFunction),
  filterConcur(someOtherFunction),
  // ...
  // No processing happens until this call
  reduceConcur(toArray()),
)

// N - 1 intermediate arrays created for N operations
const intermediateArray1 = await pMap(someFunction, someArray)
const intermediateArray2 = await pFilter(someOtherFunction, intermediateArray1)
// ...
const finalArrayWithoutLfi = await pMap(lastFunction, intermediateArrayN)
```

Concur iterables allow each item to flow through the operations independently of
other items:

```js playground
import {
  asConcur,
  filterConcur,
  mapConcur,
  pipe,
  reduceConcur,
  toArray,
} from 'lfi'
import pFilter from 'p-filter'
import pMap from 'p-map'

// Hypothetical delays for each item
const mapDelays = [5, 1, 1]
const filterDelays = [1, 1, 5]

const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))
const mapFn = i => delay(mapDelays[i] * 1000).then(() => i)
const filterFn = i => delay(filterDelays[i] * 1000).then(() => true)

// Takes 6 seconds! Each item flows through the operations independently of other items
console.time(`with lfi`)
const withLfi = await pipe(
  asConcur([0, 1, 2]),
  mapConcur(mapFn),
  filterConcur(filterFn),
  reduceConcur(toArray()),
)
console.timeEnd(`with lfi`)
// NOTE: This duration may vary slightly between runs
//=> with lfi: 6000 ms

// Takes 10 seconds! The first item is a bottleneck because `p-map` waits for all callbacks
console.time(`without lfi`)
const withoutLfi = await pFilter(await pMap([0, 1, 2], mapFn), filterFn)
console.timeEnd(`without lfi`)
// NOTE: This duration may vary slightly between runs
//=> without lfi: 10000 ms
```

:::note

`p-map`, `p-filter`, and others are still great lightweight utilities suitable
for many use cases.

## How does it work?

The `asConcur` function constructs a concur iterable from a sync iterable. Here
is a simplified implementation:

```js
const concurIteratorSymbol = Symbol(`concurIterator`)

const asConcur = iterable => ({
  [concurIteratorSymbol]: apply =>
    Promise.all(Array.from(iterable, value => apply(value))),
})
```

The implementation returns an object with a function that calls the `apply`
callback for each value in the iterable and returns a promise that resolves once
all values have been processed, all while accounting for any async processing in
`apply`.

We can iterate over concur iterables:

```js playground
import { asConcur, concurIteratorSymbol } from 'lfi'

const concurIterable = asConcur([`sloth`, `lazy`, `sleep`])

await concurIterable[concurIteratorSymbol](console.log)
//=> sloth
//=> lazy
//=> sleep
```

We can manually filter and map them:

```js playground
import { asConcur, concurIteratorSymbol } from 'lfi'

const API_URL = `https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com/random/adjective`

const concurIterable = asConcur([`sloth`, `lazy`, `sleep`])

const transformedConcurIterable = {
  [concurIteratorSymbol]: apply =>
    concurIterable[concurIteratorSymbol](async verb => {
      const [adjective] = await (await fetch(API_URL)).json()
      if (adjective.length <= 5) {
        // Too short!
        return
      }

      await apply(`${adjective} ${verb}`)
    }),
}

await transformedConcurIterable[concurIteratorSymbol](console.log)
// NOTE: This order may change between runs
//=> educated sloth
//=> favorite sleep
```

Or we can use `lfi`'s functions to filter and map them!

```js playground
import { asConcur, filterMapConcur, forEachConcur, pipe } from 'lfi'

const API_URL = `https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com/random/adjective`

await pipe(
  asConcur([`sloth`, `lazy`, `sleep`]),
  filterMapConcur(async verb => {
    const [adjective] = await (await fetch(API_URL)).json()
    return adjective.length <= 5 ? null : `${adjective} ${verb}`
  }),
  forEachConcur(console.log),
)
// NOTE: This order may change between runs
//=> educated sloth
//=> favorite sleep
```
